# baba-is-you-modding-info
An informational resource for Baba Is You modders and modpack creators.

Contains information about:
  - Preexisting Baba Is You mods
  - Baba Is You mod programming
  - Baba Is You mod and level design tips
  - Baba Is You custom assets (sprites / palettes / effects / music)

Just to be completely clear, this is not about how to create and design Baba Is You mods on a high level (for that I would recommend [Plasmaflare's excellent modding guide](https://github.com/PlasmaFlare/baba-modding-guide/blob/master/Readme.md)). This is about particular Baba Is You functions and tables as well as Baba Is You level design strategies.

If you ever get stuck on a problem with your mod and this does not contain the answer, [read the relevant code in the Mega Modpack](https://github.com/PlasmaFlare/baba-mega-modpack/tree/main/Lua) to see if anyone else has ran into something similar. Remember to read the code for functions and tables to see if you are missing anything obvious about their inputs, usage or returns.

Make sure to ask for permission before using any custom assets and please message me if anything is missing.
