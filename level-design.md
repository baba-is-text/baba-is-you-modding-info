# Level design
Some guidelines for level design in Baba Is You modpacks are:

- Make sure that your levels have enough reliance on mods
- Explore every special case in your mods' code
- If there are any interactions that you find interesting, make sure to use them
- Make sure that you have lots of levels involving each mod and remember that the levels are more important than the mods
- Include multiple levels that combine your mods
- Have at least one [metapuzzle](level-design/metapuzzles) somewhere, it really increases the quality
- Create a good [level aesthetic](level-design/aesthetic)
- Make sure that your [worlds and maps](level-design/worlds-and-maps) are designed in a gratifying and non-restrictive way
- Keep [tutorial levels](level-design/tutorials) to a minimum

Make sure to find all the existing mechanics in Baba Is You that work well with your mods (for example a parsing mod may work well with letters and WORD, whereas a movement mod would work better with movement keywords such as FEAR and SWAP)

Most levels made for movement mods are *machining* levels, which are levels that require the player to create a machine. These mostly consist of [alternators](level-design/alternator) and [switch levels](level-design/switch-level). If you have a movement mod, definitely see what machining levels you can make, but make sure to include some things other than alternators and switch levels for diversity and originality.

No matter what your mod is, you may want to try to create an [escape level](level-design/escape-level) with it. These are levels where you escape from a room, usually by breaking rules.
